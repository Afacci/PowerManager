Power\-Manager is a free software for optimization of energy dispaching, with particular regards to distributed generation.

Power\-Manager simulates the energy fluxes between the components of the plant and between the pant and, energy loads and eventually the electric grid. The optimal plant state is determined using dynamic programming, in order to minimize the total costs (or maximize the profits), including, fuel, maintenance, plant ignition, and eventual energy purchase costs, and energy selling revenues. Constraints on the minimum duration of the operation intervals of the plant are also considered. \hypertarget{index_Licence}{}\section{Licence}\label{index_Licence}
