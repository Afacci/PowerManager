!>\brief Objective function.
!>\details Returns the value of the objective function for a given plant state,
!> time step and optimization criterion. This procedure accounts only for
!> functions that are local in time, that is, that are function only of the
!> plant state at time t and not at time > t, neither at time < t.
!>\param[in] obj the optimization criterion.
!>\param[in] c   index of the given set-point to be given as input. Defines the state of the plant \f$sp(i) = sp(c\_(i))\f$
!>\param[in] t   time step index. Note t=x meas the x'th time step from the

real(kind = prec) function objFunction(c,t,obj)
