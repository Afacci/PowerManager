!>\section Introduction 
!>    PowerManager is a free software for optimization of energy
!>    dispaching, with particular regards to distributed generation.
!>    
!>    PowerManager simulates the energy fluxes between the components
!>    of the plant and between the pant and, energy loads and
!>    eventually the electric grid. The optimal plant state is
!>    determined using dynamic programming, in order to minimize the
!>    total costs (or maximize the profits), including, fuel, maintenance, plant ignition,
!>    and eventual energy purchase costs, and energy selling revenues.
!>    Constraints on the minimum duration of the operation intervals
!>    of the plant are also considered.
